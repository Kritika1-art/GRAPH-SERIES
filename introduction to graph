 // graph is a type of data structure which has two components i.e., nodes and edges
  
//graph is like a network where one or more node is connected with one another with the help of edges


On the basis of direction there are two types of graph

1. Undirected GRAPH         2. Directed GRAPH


In UNDIRECTED GRAPH if there is an edge says u-v, then it means u->v && v->u.   Notation: u-v

In DIRECTED GRAPH if there is an edge says u->v,then it means u->v only.   Notation: u->v


//NOTE: It is not necessary that graph should be enclosed it can be an open network also.



Cycles in  a Graph:

If the graph starts from a node and ends at the same node, then it means there is a cycle in a graph.


Path:
It contains a lot of nodes and each  of them are reachable.

A node can't appear twice in the path.



Degrees in  a Graph:

1. DIRECTED
    
    Here there are two types of degrees:

a. Indegree                     b. Outdegree


Indegree means that the total no. of edges going inside from a particular node.

Outdegree means that the total no. of edges coming out from a particular node.

2. UNDIRECTED

total no. of edges going inside or outside from a particular node.


EDGE WEIGHT:

A graph where edges are given some value.

If No value is given to edge, we consider it as a unit weight.
